<chapter title="Using Master" file="Use">

The aim of mastermind is to guess the sequence of four colours selected by the computer; no colour will be used more than once. Click <mouse>Select</mouse> on the iconbar icon to open the main window and fill in the first empty row in the table by dragging colours down from the line at the top; to lose a peg, drag it off the area of squares. When you have completed the row, click on the <icon>Score</icon> button and the computer will mark the guess.

A black mark indicates a colour in the correct place; a white mark indicates a correct colour in the wrong column. Unless you have got four black marks, fill the second row in the same way. You can drag colours from any of the rows you have already filled.

Once you have guessed the code, click on <icon>New</icon> for a new game.
