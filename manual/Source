<chapter title="Installing Decode" file="Install">

<cite>Decode</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 or later, and can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc. To install <cite>Decode</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Decode</file> application to a suitable place on your disc.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Using Decode" file="Use">

The aim of <cite>Decode</cite> is to guess a sequence of four colours selected randomly by the computer. Load it on to the iconbar in the usual way and click <mouse>select</mouse> on its icon to open the game window.

Sequences always contain four different coloured pegs from the row of ten at the top of the window: no colour will be used more than once. Up to twelve guesses can be made and after each, the computer will score the guess to show how close it is to the correct answer. Using this information, it should be possible to identify the chosen sequence.

Starting with row 1, whose number will be highlighted in red, drag pegs from the row at the top of the window to the four larger holes on the left. Pegs already in the row can be dragged to move them around: the rows below can be used as &lsquo;scratch space&rsquo; if required. To lose a peg completely, drop it away from a hole.

Once the row is complete and able to be scored, a <icon>?</icon> button appears to its right: click on this, and the computer will mark the guess. Marks are given using the smaller holes on the right: a black peg indicates a correct colour that is in the correct position in the row, while a white peg indicates a correct colour that is in the wrong position. The order of the black and white pegs has no significance.

Unless you strike lucky with four black pegs on the first attempt, the game moves on to row 2 and the process repeats until the correct sequence is found (or all twelve rows are used). After the first row, pegs can also be dragged in from previous guesses in the rows above.

Once you have guessed the code or run out of attempts (or just got bored of the current sequence), click <mouse>menu</mouse> over the main window and select <menu>New Game</menu>.

The <menu>Solid Drags</menu> option in the iconbar menu alternates between dragging sprites and dotted boxes; there is rarely any need to turn this option off.
